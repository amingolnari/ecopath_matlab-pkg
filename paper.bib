abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Societal and scientific challenges foster the implementation of the ecosystem approach to marine ecosystem analysis and management, which is a comprehensive means of integrating the direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors on the different components of ecosystems, from physical to chemical and biological and from viruses to fishes and marine mammals. Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) is a widely used software package, which offers capability for a dynamic description of the multiple interactions occurring within a food web, and, potentially, a crucial component of an integrated platform supporting the ecosystem approach. However, being written for the Microsoft .NET framework, seamless integration of this code with Fortran-based physical and/or biogeochemical oceanographic models is technically not straightforward. In this work we release a re-coding of EwE in Fortran (EwE-F). We believe that the availability of a Fortran version of EwE is an important step towards setting up coupled/integrated modelling schemes utilising this widely adopted software because it (i) increases portability of the EwE models and (ii) provides additional flexibility towards integrating EwE with Fortran-based modelling schemes. Furthermore, EwE-F might help modellers using the Fortran programming language to get close to the EwE approach. In the present work, first fundamentals of EwE-F are introduced, followed by validation of EwE-F against standard EwE utilising sample models. Afterwards, an end-to-end (E2E) ecological representation of the Gulf of Trieste (northern Adriatic Sea) ecosystem is presented as an example of online two-way coupling between an EwE-F food web model and a biogeochemical model. Finally, the possibilities that having EwE-F opens up are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) modeling approach combines software for ecosystem trophic mass balance analysis (Ecopath), 
with a dynamic modeling capability (Ecosim) for exploring past and future impacts of fishing and environmental disturbances 
as well as for exploring optimal fishing policies. Ecosim models can be replicated over a spatial map grid (Ecospace) to allow 
exploration of policies such as marine protected areas, while accounting for spatial dispersal/advection effects. 
The Ecopath approach and software has been under development for two decades, with Ecosim emerging in 1995, and 
Ecospace in 1998, leading to an integrated and widely applied package. We present an overview of the computational aspects of 
the Ecopath, Ecosim and Ecospace modules as they are implemented in the most recent software version. The paper summarizes 
the capabilities of the modeling system with respect to evaluating how fisheries and the environment impact ecosystems. We 
conclude by a warning about pitfalls in the use of the software for policy exploration.

abstract = {The eruption of the Kasatochi volcano in August 2008 stimulated an anomalously high phytoplankton bloom in the otherwise iron-limited subarctic Pacific ocean. It has been proposed that this increased production may have been responsible for record returns of some Pacific salmon stocks in the following years. Here, we investigate the potential effect of volcanic-induced iron fertilization on the entire ecosystem, from phytoplankton through to top predators, using a fully-coupled end-to-end ecosystem model. Our simulations indicate that the volcanic iron fertilization could only stimulate modest increases, at most 10{\%}, in the standing stock biomass of upper trophic level species, including fisheries targets such as Pacific salmon. Propagation of energy to higher trophic levels depends on the timing of the eruption, with more efficient crustaceous zooplankton pathways being favored earlier in the growing season and less-efficient gelatinous zooplankton pathways dominating during later months. However, effects were of modest magnitude for all eruption timings, and the strong level of connectivity within the food web makes the preferential stimulation of a single salmon stock implausible. This adds additional support to evidence suggesting that the Kasatochi eruption did not play a large role in subsequent high salmon returns and questions the value of much smaller-scale artificial fertilization for fisheries. Indeed, the onset of macronutrient limitation coupled with the highly-connected nature of the food web exert strong controls on the fisheries response to even complete removal of iron limitation in the subarctic Pacific.},

abstract = {We used an end-to-end ecosystem model that incorporates physics, biogeochemistry, and predatorâˆ’prey dynamics for the Eastern Subarctic Pacific ecosystem to investigate the factors controlling propagation of changes in primary production to higher trophic levels. We found that lower trophic levels respond to increased primary production in unexpected ways due to complex predatory interactions, with small phytoplankton increasing more than large phytoplankton due to relief from predation by microzooplankton, which are kept in check by the more abundant mesozooplankton. We also found that the propagation of production to upper trophic levels depends critically on how non- predatory mortality is structured in the model, with much greater propagation occurring with linear mortality and much less with quadratic mortality, both of which functional forms are in common use in ecosystem models. We used an ensemble simulation approach to examine how uncertainties in model parameters affect these results. When considering the full range of potential responses to enhanced productivity, the effect of uncertainties related to the functional form of non-predatory mortality was often masked by uncertainties in the food-web parameter- ization. The predicted responses of several commercially important species, however, were significantly altered by non-predatory mortality assumptions.},

This paper presents a thorough description of the model itself, as well as an ensemble-based parameterization process that allows the model to incorporate the high level of uncertainty associated with many upper trophic level predator-prey processes. Through a series of model architecture experiments, we demonstrate that the use of a consistent functional response for all predator-prey interactions, as well as the use of density-dependent mortality rates for planktonic functional groups, are important factors in reproducing annual and seasonal observations. We present the results of a 50-year climatological simulation, which demonstrates that under contemporary physical forcing, the model is capable of reproducing long-term seasonal dynamics in primary production and biogeochemical cycling, while maintaining steady-state coexistence of upper trophic level functional groups at levels consistent with observations.},

abstract = {Ecological network analysis (ENA) provides numerous ecosystem level indices offering a valuable approach to compare and categorize the ecological structure and function of ecosystems. The inclusion of ENA methods in Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) has insured their continued contribution to ecosystem-based management. In EwE, ENA-derived ecological conclusions are currently based on single values of ENA indices calculated from a unique input flow matrix. Here, we document an easy-to-use routine that allows EwE users to incorporate uncertainty in EwE input data into the calculation of ENA indices. This routine, named ENAtool, is a suite of Matlab functions that performs three main steps: (1) import of an existing Ecopath model and its associated parameter uncertainty values in the form of uncertainty intervals into Matlab; (2) generation of an ensemble of Ecopath models with the same structure as the original, and with parameter values varying based on the prescribed uncertainty limits; and (3) calculation of a set of 13 ENA indices for each ensemble member (one set of flow values) and of summary statistics across the whole ensemble. This novel routine offers the opportunity to calculate ENA indices ranges and confidence intervals, and thus to perform quantitative data analyses. An application of ENAtool on a pre-existing Ecopath model of the Bay of Biscay continental shelf is presented, with a focus on the robustness of previously published ENA-based ecological traits of this ecosystem when the newly introduced uncertainty values are added. We also describe the sensitivity of the ENAtool results to both the number of ensemble members used and to the uncertainty interval set around each input parameter. Ecological conclusions derived from EwE, particularly those regarding the comparison of structural and functional elements for a range of ecosystem types or the assessment of ecosystem properties along gradients of environmental conditions or anthropogenic disturbances, will gain in statistical interpretability.},

@phdthesis{Kearney2012a,
abstract = {Over the past decade, fisheries management efforts have placed increased emphasis on ecosystem-based management, where the interactions between a target stock species and its physical and biological environment are considered in addition to sustainability of the stock itself. At the same time, global-scale climate models that historically focused only on physical and biogeochemical variables are increasingly incorporating biological variables. With these shifts, the historical separation between climate modeling and fisheries modeling is closing, with increased interest in the concept of end-to-end models, i.e. models that incorporate dynamics from physics to top predators. In this dissertation, I develop a modeling framework that fully couples a one-dimensional physical mixed layer model, a biogeochemical model, and an upper trophic level fisheries food web model. I present a thorough description of the model itself, as well as an ensemble-based parameterization process that allows the model to incorporate the high level of uncertainty associated with many upper trophic level predator-prey processes. Through a series of model architecture experiments, I demonstrate that the use of a consistent functional response for all predator-prey interactions, as well as the use of density-dependent mortality rates for planktonic functional groups, are important factors in reproducing annual and seasonal observations. Following the development and validation of the end-to-end ecosystem model, I use the model to simulate the response of an ecosystem to a bottom-up perturbation, namely an increase in net primary production due to alleviation of micronutrient limitation. I also look at the impact of non-predatory mortality, one of the least-constrained model processes, on the energy flow through the system. We find that the relative changes in production at higher trophic levels are amplified under density-independent non-predatory mortality assumptions but damped under density-dependent assumptions. However, the high parameter uncertainty masks this effect in predicted values for most functional groups. Overall, the model developed in this dissertation addresses a growing need to thoroughly diagnose the behavior of, and quantify the uncertainty associated with, complex ecosystem models that bridge physical, biological, and socio-economic boundaries. Such detailed dynamical characterization of model behavior is essential before ecosystem models can be applied to management applications.},
