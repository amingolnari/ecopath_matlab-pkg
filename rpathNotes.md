### TODO list

- change in names of Rpath stanza tables: stgroups and stindiv (as opposed to stgroups and stanzas... much better).  May need to updates file default names
- partial producers... am I consistent with Rpath?
- BA for multistanza groups... can they be different?
- VGBF_d: EwE assumes to be 2/3 (specialized von Bert. curve).  Rpath uses generalized curve, so d is flexible
- Rename setstanzas... checkstanza, maybe?
- Demonstrate ensemble-generation PB and QB vs PB and GE (with pedigrees set to propagate error accordingly)

- aggregating groups
  - what to do when biomass is missing for one or more aggregates?
