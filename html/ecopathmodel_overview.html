  </style></head><body><div class="content"><h1>An overview of the ecopathmodel class</h1><!--introduction--><p>The ecopathmodel class offers a Matlab-based implementation of the popular Ecopath mass-balance algorithm.  For information on the Ecopath concept, I refer you to the official Ecopath with Ecosim website: <a href="http://ecopath.org/">http://ecopath.org/</a>, as well as to the following journal articles:</p><p>Christensen, V. &amp; Pauly, D. ECOPATH II--a software for balancing steady-state ecosystem models and calculating network characteristics. Ecological Modelling 61, 169-185 (1992).</p><p>Christensen, V. &amp; Walters, C. J. Ecopath with Ecosim: methods, capabilities and limitations. Ecological Modelling 172, 109-139 (2004).</p><p>This overview assumes that you are already familiar with the Ecopath concept, and simply focuses on the use of this particular implementation.  Please note that this code is intended to replicate only the Ecopath algorithm, not Ecosim, Ecospace, or any of the other Ecopath-derived functionalities within the full EwE software.</p><!--/introduction--><h2>Contents</h2><div><ul><li><a href="#1">The <tt>ecopathmodel</tt> object</a></li><li><a href="#2">Importing Ecopath data</a></li><li><a href="#4">Building an <tt>ecopathmodel</tt> object manually</a></li></ul></div><h2>The <tt>ecopathmodel</tt> object<a name="1"></a></h2><p>The foundation of this package is the ecopathmodel object, which holds all the input data related to a particular modeled ecosystem.  This includes the  definition of functional groups and fishing fleets and the connections between them, as well as the many parameters associated with each state variable and group-to-group flow process.</p><p>Currently, there are three ways to create one of these objects:</p><div><ol><li>Load data from an EwE6 database file</li><li>Load data from a set of Rpath-formatted .csv files</li><li>Build the model manually</li></ol></div><p>If you have a prexisting model, the first two methods are preferable to manual transcription, since in my experience it is very easy to accidentally mis-transcribe a value, or transcribe it using less precision than in the original model.  Building a model manually has the advantage of providing a clear "paper trail" for all your model parameters, but you have to be careful that you fill in all the necessary values.  While I provide a few basic checks of input, I'm not quite as good as EwE6 is at  required vs. optional given the architecture of your specific ecosystem.</p><p>Personally, I prefer a combination of the two techniques, where possible. Use the EwE6 software during the initial data-gathering step of building an Ecopath model.  That will allow you to take advantage of all the graphical utilities that warn you when parameters are incorrect.  Once the model data is acceptable, and the Ecopath Parameterization calculations in EwE6 return a balanced (or at least nearly-balanced) result, move over to this tool for project-specific parameter adjustments.  This process allows you to preserve one copy of the base model while also keeping project-specific details clearly documented.</p><h2>Importing Ecopath data<a name="2"></a></h2><p>The current version of Ecopath with Ecosim stores data in specially-formatted Microsoft Access database file, with the .EwEmdb extension.  The <tt>mdb2ecopathmodel</tt> function will read data from one of these files into an <tt>ecopathmodel</tt> object, with two caveats:</p><div><ol><li>You need to first install the <tt>mdbtools</tt> set of command-line utilities. They're available for download here: https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools. Install instruction for *nix systems are included on GitHub; for Mac, I recommend installing via either MacPorts or Homebrew.  Windows users (and I know that's most of the Ecopath-using community): I've never compiled this tool on a Windows machine, though I know it can be done.  I don't work with any Windows machines myself, so this is a big shortcoming in this code base at the moment. If any of compiled mdbtools on a Windows system, or have a better way of reading .mdb files into Matlab on a Windows machine, please contact me!</li><li>I expect all files to use the EwE6 format.  If you have older files, you'll first need to import them into EwE6 and let its conversion tool convert to the newer format.</li></ol></div><p>This example reads in one of the example ecosystems that ships with the EwE6 software:</p><pre class="codeinput">epfolder = <span class="string">'~/Documents/Research/Working/EcopathModels/'</span>;
Gen37 = mdb2ecopathmodel(fullfile(epfolder, <span class="string">'Generic_37.EwEmdb'</span>));

</pre><p>When importing, you'll usually encounter a few warnings like those seen above.  EwE6 uses a few NaN-placeholders in its data files, which are then converted to 0s when it performs the Ecopath calculation.  My code replaces those placeholders on reading, and lets you know.  It also alters names, if necessary.  If you're not happy with the "translation", you simply alter the <tt>names</tt>, <tt>fleets</tt>, or <tt>stanzas</tt> variables, and these changes will propagate to the rest of the tables.  For example, I don't like those trailing underscores on a couple groups:</p><pre class="codeinput">Gen37.name{11} = <span class="string">'Pelagics_Small_Carniv'</span>;
Gen37.name{12} = <span class="string">'Pelagics_Small_Herbiv'</span>;

</pre><h2>Building an <tt>ecopathmodel</tt> object manually<a name="4"></a></h2><p>As I mentioned above, I don't really recommend that you start a model from scratch using just this tool.  My focus when developing this code was to increase the flexibility of the Ecopath algorithm, not to replicate the EwE6 GUI capabilities (including its many data validation checks).</p><p>However, Ecopath models are very often published in peer-reviewed journals or technical reports without accompanying data files.  In these cases, you many need to manually transcribe the data from various printed tables in order to carry out additional calculations.</p><p>For this example, I'm going to using the Eastern Pacific Subarctic Gyre ecosystem model, which is the one I happened to be working with during the development of this class, and which required manual transcription. The details of that model were published in</p><p>Aydin KY, McFarlane GA, King JR, Megrey BA (2003) The BASS/MODEL report on trophic models of the Subarctic Pacific Basin ecosystems. PICES Sci Rep 25</p><p>To build an empty <tt>ecopathmodel</tt> object, you need 3 parameters:</p><div><ul><li>number of total groups</li><li>number of live groups</li><li>number of fishing gears/fleets.</li></ul></div><p>While not required, it's highly recommended that you also add the names of all groups, fleets, and stanzas, since that data is used to set up and label all the table columns and rows, and the type of each group (i.e. whether consumer, producer, or mixotroph), since that is used to validate other parameters' values as they're added.</p><pre class="codeinput">names = {<span class="keyword">...</span>

Pretty please?</p><p>Anyway, diet data was copied and pasted from Table B8 (all 5 pages of it) of the report into a csv file, which I've pasted here to minimize the number of supporting files needed for this example.</p><pre class="codeinput">dietcsv = {<span class="keyword">...</span>

%% An overview of the ecopathmodel class
%
% The ecopathmodel class offers a Matlab-based implementation of the
% popular Ecopath mass-balance algorithm.  For information on the Ecopath
% concept, I refer you to the official Ecopath with Ecosim website:
% http://ecopath.org/, as well as to the following journal articles:
%
% Christensen, V. & Pauly, D. ECOPATH IIREPLACE_WITH_DASH_DASHa software for balancing
% steady-state ecosystem models and calculating network characteristics.
% Ecological Modelling 61, 169-185 (1992).  
% 
% Christensen, V. & Walters, C. J. Ecopath with Ecosim: methods,
% capabilities and limitations. Ecological Modelling 172, 109-139 (2004).
%
% This overview assumes that you are already familiar with the Ecopath
% concept, and simply focuses on the use of this particular
% implementation.  Please note that this code is intended to replicate only
% the Ecopath algorithm, not Ecosim, Ecospace, or any of the other
% Ecopath-derived functionalities within the full EwE software.  
%
%% The |ecopathmodel| object
%
% The foundation of this package is the ecopathmodel object, which holds
% all the input data related to a particular modeled ecosystem.  This
% includes the  definition of functional groups and fishing fleets and the
% connections between them, as well as the many parameters associated with
% each state variable and group-to-group flow process.  
%
% Currently, there are three ways to create one of these objects:
%
% # Load data from an EwE6 database file
% # Load data from a set of Rpath-formatted .csv files
% # Build the model manually
%
% If you have a prexisting model, the first two methods are preferable to
% manual transcription, since in my experience it is very easy to
% accidentally mis-transcribe a value, or transcribe it using less
% precision than in the original model.  Building a model manually has the
% advantage of providing a clear "paper trail" for all your model
% parameters, but you have to be careful that you fill in all the necessary
% values.  While I provide a few basic checks of input, I'm not quite as
% good as EwE6 is at  required vs. optional given the architecture of your
% specific ecosystem.
%
% Personally, I prefer a combination of the two techniques, where possible.
% Use the EwE6 software during the initial data-gathering step of building
% an Ecopath model.  That will allow you to take advantage of all the
% graphical utilities that warn you when parameters are incorrect.  Once
% the model data is acceptable, and the Ecopath Parameterization
% calculations in EwE6 return a balanced (or at least nearly-balanced)
% result, move over to this tool for project-specific parameter
% adjustments.  This process allows you to preserve one copy of the base
% model while also keeping project-specific details clearly documented.

%% Importing Ecopath data
%
% The current version of Ecopath with Ecosim stores data in
% specially-formatted Microsoft Access database file, with the .EwEmdb
% extension.  The |mdb2ecopathmodel| function will read data from one of
% these files into an |ecopathmodel| object, with two caveats:
%
% # You need to first install the |mdbtools| set of command-line utilities.
% They're available for download here: https://github.com/brianb/mdbtools.
% Install instruction for *nix systems are included on GitHub; for Mac, I
% recommend installing via either MacPorts or Homebrew.  Windows users (and
% I know that's most of the Ecopath-using community): I've never compiled
% this tool on a Windows machine, though I know it can be done.  I don't
% work with any Windows machines myself, so this is a big shortcoming in
% this code base at the moment. If any of compiled mdbtools on a Windows
% system, or have a better way of reading .mdb files into Matlab on a
% Windows machine, please contact me!  
% # I expect all files to use the EwE6 format.  If you have older files,
% you'll first need to import them into EwE6 and let its conversion tool
% convert to the newer format.
%
% This example reads in one of the example ecosystems that ships with the
% EwE6 software:
%

epfolder = '~/Documents/Research/Working/EcopathModels/';
Gen37 = mdb2ecopathmodel(fullfile(epfolder, 'Generic_37.EwEmdb'));

%%
% When importing, you'll usually encounter a few warnings like those seen
% above.  EwE6 uses a few NaN-placeholders in its data files, which are
% then converted to 0s when it performs the Ecopath calculation.  My code
% replaces those placeholders on reading, and lets you know.  It also
% alters names, if necessary.  If you're not happy with the "translation", 
% you simply alter the |names|, |fleets|, or |stanzas| variables, and these
% changes will propagate to the rest of the tables.  For example, I don't
% like those trailing underscores on a couple groups:

Gen37.name{11} = 'Pelagics_Small_Carniv';
Gen37.name{12} = 'Pelagics_Small_Herbiv';

Gen37.groupdata

%% Building an |ecopathmodel| object manually
%
% As I mentioned above, I don't really recommend that you start a model
% from scratch using just this tool.  My focus when developing this code
% was to increase the flexibility of the Ecopath algorithm, not to
% replicate the EwE6 GUI capabilities (including its many data validation
% checks).  
%
% However, Ecopath models are very often published in peer-reviewed
% journals or technical reports without accompanying data files.  In these
% cases, you many need to manually transcribe the data from various printed
% tables in order to carry out additional calculations.
%
% For this example, I'm going to using the Eastern Pacific Subarctic Gyre
% ecosystem model, which is the one I happened to be working with during
% the development of this class, and which required manual transcription.
% The details of that model were published in
%
% Aydin KY, McFarlane GA, King JR, Megrey BA (2003) The BASS/MODEL report
% on trophic models of the Subarctic Pacific Basin ecosystems. PICES Sci
% Rep 25  

%%
% To build an empty |ecopathmodel| object, you need 3 parameters:
%
% * number of total groups
% * number of live groups
% * number of fishing gears/fleets.
%
% While not required, it's highly recommended that you also add the names
% of all groups, fleets, and stanzas, since that data is used to set up and
% label all the table columns and rows, and the type of each group (i.e.
% whether consumer, producer, or mixotroph), since that is used to validate
% other parameters' values as they're added.

isprod = ismember(names, {'Large phytoplankton', 'Small phytoplankton'});
isdet = ismember(names, {'DNH3', 'POM'});

pp = zeros(ngroup,1); % 0 = consumer
pp(isprod) = 1;       % 1 = producer
pp(isdet) = 2;        % 2 = detritus

% Names of groups, fleets, and stanzas must meet Matlab's variable name
% restrictions, since they will be used as table row/column labels.  To
% meet this requirement, here I capitalize all words and then strip out
% spaces and special characters. 

names = regexprep(names,'(\<[a-z])','${upper($1)}');
names = regexprep(names, '[\s-\.'']', '');

% Now create empty ecopathmodel

Esa = ecopathmodel(ngroup, nlive, ngear, 'groups', names, 'pp', pp)

%%
% The ecoathmodel object properties include several table arrays.  You can
% refer to the ecopathmodel property descriptions (|help ecopathmodel|) to
% see what parameters are stored in each table.  The variable names are all
% based on those used in EwE6, so they should be familiar to most Ecopath
% users.    

%%
% Now it's time to start adding the data.  We'll start with the groupdata
% table, which holds all the group-related parameters.

Esa.groupdata

%%
% The first several columns of the groupdata table correspond to the "Basic
% input" panel in EwE6.  These, along with diet fractions, are the
% parameters most likely to be published in any Ecopath-related study.
% In this case, the values come straight from Table B6 in the Aydin et al.,
% 2003 report.
%
% You'll notice a few warning messages printed to the screen as I add the
% data into the appropriate tables; those are letting me know that I tried
% to add invalid values to certain locations.  In this case, the
% discrepancy is that the printed table left some values blank where
% internally they're actually supposed to be 0; those incorrect NaNs are
% replaced with the appropriate 0s by the data validator.

% Columns are trophic level (TL), biomass (B, t/km2), production/biomass
% (P/B, 1/year), consumption/biomass (Q/B, 1/year), ecotrophic efficiency
% (EE, proportion), growth efficiency (PC, proportion) biomass accumulation
% (BA t/km2/year), unassimilated respiration (UnAss, proportion) and the
% proportion of detritus flowing to NH3 and POM, respectively

% Next up, diet fractions.  Here's one of my personal pet peeves:
% publishing sparse matrices (like Ecopath diet fraction matrices) as  
% tables of mostly empty space spread across multiple printed pages.  Can
% we all agree to stop doing this?  Pretty please?

% Anyway, diet data was copied and pasted from Table B8 (all 5 pages of it)
% of the report into a csv file, which I've pasted here to minimize the
% number of supporting files needed for this example.

% There are a few remaining variables that weren't really discussed in the
% Aydin et al. report, but are necessary to replicate their Ecopath
% calculations.

% Detritus import: assume to be 0 for both detritus groups

% Immigration/emigration: Assume 0

Esa.groupdata.immig = zeros(ngroup,1);

% Fisheries landings and discards: Assume no fisheries loss in this model.

Esa.landing(:,:) = num2cell(zeros(ngroup,ngear));

% Discard fate: Values don't really matter, since there are no discards to
% redirect, but as a placeholder, split this between the two detrital
% groups.

Esa.discardFate(:,:) = {0.5, 0.5};

% Finally, the detritus groups are currently listed with no biomass or
% import.  The Aydin et al., 2003 work used a precursor to the Rpath model
% for its calculations, rather than the more familiar EwE platform. One
% difference between Rpath and EwE is that Rpath calculates detrital pool
% biomass based on an assumed overturning rate.  This Matlab package also
% allows that possibility, via the |detpb| column.  However, the rate used
% in this particular study wasn't published, so I took the easy way out and
% simply substituted some approximate values (for Ecopath balance purposes,
% this number doesn't affect the calculations at all).

Esa.groupdata.b(isdet) = ones(ngroup-nlive,1)*50;

%% 
% At this point, we have a fully-populated ecopathmodel object, and can
% run the ecopath method to calculate the mass balance.
